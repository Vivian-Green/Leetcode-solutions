Problem: MEDIUM - https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers

first attempt: https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/submissions/943432164/ - runtime beats 98%, memory beats 96%


I honestly thought I did horribly with how my code looked, but apparently 98% of people did eve more horribly. The top 0.25% looks about as clean as I figured it *should* from the perceived simplicity of the problem, and are 7x faster.
