 Problem: HARD - https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/
 
 first attempt: https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/submissions/943459474/ - runtime beats 91%, memory beats 99%
 
 cleaner: https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/submissions/943495979/ - same speed, just nicer looking.

 further optimized: https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/submissions/943500818/ - I think this is about as good as I can do without giving myself a headache
  - removed a branch in the findMedianSortedArrays loop
